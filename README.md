# Cloud Practice Labs üöÄ

Demonstrating my practical understanding of AWS services, version control, and DevOps principles through real-world inspired mini-projects.

## About Me

I'm an aspiring DevOps/Cloud professional with a background in IT, retail operations, and cyber security fundamentals. My journey started with a BTEC Level 3 in IT and a hands-on Cyber Security course with Code Nation, where I secured a WordPress site and worked with tools like Kali Linux and Nmap.

Currently, I'm building foundational skills in:

- **AWS (EC2, S3, IAM)**  
- **Version control using Git & GitHub**  
- **Containerization with Docker**  
- **Infrastructure as Code concepts**

This repo will track my technical learning through small, practical projects that simulate real-world DevOps tasks. My goal is to not just learn tools, but show how I can apply them in a professional environment.

## üîß Projects in Progress

### 1. Static Website Deployment (AWS S3)
Deploying a basic HTML/CSS website to AWS S3 as a public-facing static site. Focus:  
- Bucket policy configuration  
- File hosting and versioning  
- Basic CI-style update workflow via GitHub

‚û°Ô∏è *Coming Soon: Add EC2 version with Apache deployment*

---

### 2. Git & Version Control Workflow Practice
Using Git CLI and GitHub to:
- Manage versions of my project code  
- Create feature branches and merge pull requests  
- Build habits around commit messages, structure, and collaboration

---

### 3. DevOps Pipeline Planning
Outlining a simple CI/CD pipeline (in-progress) that simulates:
- Code push triggering a deployment step  
- Future goal: Integrate Docker and GitHub Actions

---

## üß† What's Next

- Learn how to use **EC2** to serve a basic Node.js or Python app  
- Begin containerizing simple projects using **Docker**  
- Explore Infrastructure as Code via **CloudFormation**
